Create a basic "Your orders" app in React.js and ES6

The app must have the following functionality:
 * Each order consists of:
   * A product name and code
   * A delivery address (single line)
   * A quantity and total price
   * An order date
   * Whether it has been delivered or not
 * There is a list view showing the product name and total price
   * It is paginated
   * By default, it's ordered by order date, descending (newest first)
   * You can order by order date ascending or descending
   * You can order by total price, ascending or descending
 * You can see the rest of the details if you click on a product
   * It can be a popup, expando, etc. Your choice.
   * It should show all of the rest of the details not visible in the list view
 * You must be able to search (single search box)
   * By product name
   * By product code
   * By delivery address
 * There is a settings page with the following settings, which persist between navigation:
   * Checkbox: show orders older than a month
   * Textbox: current address
 * You can deep-link
   * To a particular page in the list view
   * To particular expanded product in the list view
   * To the settings page

When you're done, create a Git bundle, and send it us:
`git bundle create <your-name>.bundle HEAD`

What we're looking for:
 * Take 2 or 3 hours at most
 * You don't have to finish all of the requirements, but most of them, and at least one from each section/functionality
 * A small explanation on how would you implement the ones you didn't have time for
 * A small list of assumptions you made about the app, product, database, API, etc
 * Document how to build/run the app
 * Use a static set of data, but describe how would you integrate with an API
 * How you structure the React project
 * Which, if any, patterns, frameworks, packages, do you use
 * How do you model the data and behaviour
 * Which tests do you write
 * We will do code review in the live interview, and discuss how would we expand the product further, with more requirements

Below is some sample schema data, for your convenience. Feel free to use it, or make up your own schema/data:
